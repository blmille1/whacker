# TASK

Fix issue {{TASK_ID}}: {{ISSUE_TITLE}}

Pull in the issue using `gh issue view <ID>`. If it has a parent PRD, pull that in too.

Only work on the issue specified.

Work on branch {{BRANCH}}. Make commits and run tests.

# PROJECT CONTEXT

Before writing any code, read these files to understand the domain and architecture:

- `CONTEXT.md` — domain language and terminology (D&D 5e engine)
- `docs/adr/` — architectural decisions (SRD 5.2 foundation, engine/content separation)
- `.sandcastle/CODING_STANDARDS.md` — project coding standards

The engine is content-agnostic: it knows nothing about specific classes, species, monsters, or items. Game content lives in clearly marked directories and conforms to engine-defined schemas. Respect this separation.

# CONTEXT

Here are the last 10 commits:

<recent-commits>

!`git log -n 10 --format="%H%n%ad%n%B---" --date=short`

</recent-commits>

# EXPLORATION

Explore the repo and fill your context window with relevant information that will allow you to complete the task.

Pay extra attention to test files that touch the relevant parts of the code.

# EXECUTION

If applicable, use RGR to complete the task.

1. RED: write one test
2. GREEN: write the implementation to pass that test
3. REPEAT until done
4. REFACTOR the code

# FEEDBACK LOOPS

Before committing, run `npm run typecheck` and `npm run test` to ensure the tests pass.

# COMMIT

Make a git commit. The commit message must:

1. Start with `RALPH:` prefix
2. Include task completed + PRD reference
3. Key decisions made
4. Files changed
5. Blockers or notes for next iteration

Keep it concise.

# THE ISSUE

Once complete, output <promise>COMPLETE</promise>.

# FINAL RULES

ONLY WORK ON A SINGLE TASK.

Do not push the branch.
Do not close the issue.
Do not edit labels.
Do not create or edit PRs.
